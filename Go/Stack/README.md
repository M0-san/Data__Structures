## What are Stacks
    stacks are (LIFO) Last-In First-Out data structures 

## Usage
    - Implement the undo feature in.
    - Build compilers (parsing the syntax of an expression)
    - Evaluate expressions (2 + 3 * 9)
    - Build navigation (forward/back buttons)

## Stack Operatios:
    - push(item): push item on top of the stack.    -> O(1)
    - pop(): removes the item on the top.           -> O(1)
    - peek(): look up the element on top of stack.  -> O(1)
    - empty(): checks whether the stack is empty.   -> O(1)
