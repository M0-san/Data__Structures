## Linked List

### Description
    We use a linkedlist to store objects in a squential manner in memory,       
    But unlike arrays, likendlists can grow and shrink automatically.
    
    /*     ---------    ---------           */
    /*     | Value |    | Value |           */
    /*     |  ---  |    |  ---  |           */
    /*     |  next-|--> |  next-|--> NULL   */
    /*     ---------    ---------           */

### Complexity
    - Look Up: O(n)     
    - Insert:       
        - At the Beggining O(1).        
        - At the Middle O(n).       
        - At the End: O(1).     
    - Delete:       
        - From the Beggining O(1).      
        - From the Middle O(n).     
        - From the End O(1)
