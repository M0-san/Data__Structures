# Data Structures

## 1. Description

This repository contains a simple implementation to linear and non linear data structures as well as to some of their algorithms.
There are basically two implementations **Go** and **C++**

### 2. Goal

1. (classical data structures implementations)
2. (based on MacOS Catalina/gcc)
3. (ease of use, one or at most two header files per ds)

### 3. What is a Data Structure

A **data structure** is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification   

### 4. What is an Algorithm

An **Algorithm** basically is a **sequence of instructions**, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.    

### 5. What is Big O notation
 **Big O notation** is a way used to give the **efficiency of an algorithm**, more precisely, It tells us the **growth of an algorithm**

- **Constant**:       **O(1)**
- **Logarithmic**:    **O(Log(n)**
- **Linear**:         **O(n)**      
- **Quadratic**:      **O(n^2)** 
- **Exponential**:    **O(2^n)**

### 6. Linear Data Structures

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Tables (Map)

### 7. Non-Linear Data Structures

* Binary Trees
* AVL Tress
* Tries
* Heaps
* Graphs
* Undirected Graphs
