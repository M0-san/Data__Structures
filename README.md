# Data Structures in C++

## Description

This repository contains a simple implementation to linear and non linear data structures as well as to some of their algorithms.
There are basically two implementations **Go** and **C++**

### Goal

1. (classical data structures implementations)
2. (based on MacOS Catalina/gcc)
3. (ease of use, one or at most two header files per ds)

### What is a Data Structure


### Linear Data Structures

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Tables (Map)

### Non-Linear Data Structures

* Binary Trees
* AVL Tress
* Tries
* Heaps
* Graphs
* Undirected Graphs
